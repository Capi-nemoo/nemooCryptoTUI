## Explanation and Advice

### What the Code Does:
* Screen Setup:
The code starts by creating a full-screen terminal interface using FTXUI.
State Variables:
It defines variables to track which tab is selected (selected_tab) and whether the settings view should be displayed (show_settings).
 * Components:
            The tab menu lets the user switch between "Crypto," "Fiat," and "Favorites."
            The main component shows content based on the selected tab and includes the tab menu in its header.
            The settings component displays configuration options and instructions on how to return.
* Container:
        The components are combined in a tab container, which uses the active_tab_index variable to decide which view to display.
 * Event Handling:
        A global event handler listens for the ESC key. Pressing ESC toggles between the main content and the settings view by updating the active_tab_index.

## Advice for Future Changes:
* State Management:
As your application grows, consider organizing state variables in a dedicated structure or class. This can help manage complexity.
* Event Handling:
Right now, only the ESC key is handled. If you plan to add more interactivity (e.g., arrow keys for navigation or additional shortcuts), centralize your event handling logic.
* Code Organization:
        For larger projects, breaking components into separate files or classes can make maintenance easier.
* Focus Management:
        The call to TakeFocus() ensures the container receives keyboard events. Keep an eye on focus issues if you add more interactive components.
* Error Handling:
Consider adding logging or debugging output for events, especially when testing new features.
 * Opinion:
    The code is clean and well-structured for a simple text-based UI application.
    Using FTXUI's container and event system is an effective way to manage multiple views.
    As the project scales, you might need to refactor the code into more modular components to keep it maintainable.
